  From this page you can control a collaborative activity's room and groups. You can assign your students to groups as you prefer by giving them the URL for the group you'd like them to be in.

  Each room exists for a short period of time. You may use this span of time to create a room ahead of time and prepare whatever you need to use the generated group names to help your students set up.
